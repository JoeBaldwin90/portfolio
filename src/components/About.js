      Joe and I worked together at Loco2 for almost four years. During that time, we built a solid working relationship - often remotely via Slack and video chat. 
      Joe is incredibly hard-working - bright, thoughtful and conscientious. I was always impressed by his appetite for new information, projects and responsibility, so his move into the role of team leader at Loco2's support team was well deserved.
      He is ambitious and unusually adept at self-reflection which gives him an edge when he puts himself forward for new opportunities. I have no doubt that he will continue to thrive at Loco2 or elsewhere, and I will be cheering on his success.
